# Known-Precursor

This mod allows you to select what precursors you can find while playing. You can select anywhere from not getting any precursor up to getting all of them.
The selection menu will pop up once you hit begin. If added at a later stage the menu can be opened by running 'event precursor_selection.1' in console.

Baol and Zroni will only be available for selection if you or the host owns Ancient Relics DLC.
Baol and Zroni dig-sites will spawn nearby your starting system.

## Mutiplayer
Should work fine with some limitations.
* Any precursor marked as unique can only be started by one player
* Normal vanilla behavior will remain so if two or more players select the same precursor only the one that completes the chain first will spawn in the precursor system.
